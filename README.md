# Undertaking
Created classes to represent various components of a city bicycle lending service (E.g. bikes, docking stations, customers, service staff etc.). Created methods to simulate the relationships between these components, and to build a working model of the system as a whole. Each step was guided by converting user stories into small unit tests, using TDD to direct the production code.
